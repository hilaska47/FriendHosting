## Have You Fallen for the Get-Rich-Quick Marketing Hype?

Have you ever signed up for one of those marketing courses that promise millionaire status in just 30 days with "three easy steps"?

Here’s the truth: The only person becoming a millionaire is the one teaching the course.

## The Truth About Growing a Business

Building a successful business takes time, effort, and persistence. Anyone claiming otherwise is likely selling you false promises. Here's what you should know:  

- **Real Growth Takes Time**  
  On average, marketing results for a new business take **6 to 12 months** before generating any significant response from a targeted audience. Substantial profits may take **2 to 3 years**. This timeline reflects the reality of building trust and credibility with potential customers.

- **Quick Fixes Don't Work**  
  Gurus often claim their courses will teach you how to amass a 100,000-person email list or skyrocket sales overnight. However, growing a legitimate and engaged email list takes time. For example, when I started email marketing, it took me **three years** to build a list of 5,000 paying clients—clients who consistently used my services.
